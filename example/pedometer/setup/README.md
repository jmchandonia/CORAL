# Sample config files for the PEDOMETER Data Clearinghouse

This directory contains config files for setting up an instance
of CORAL for the PEDOMETER project.

Everything should be placed in /home/coral/prod/modules/var/ before
running the data loading script (see the installation instructions for
the CORAL back end) in a Jupyter notebook.

Note that the data loading script also needs to have the ontologies
set up first, as described in the ontologies/ subdirectory.
